# CubeBot
Recently on Fortnite, a strange cube has appeared. It has been moving on an interval and then stopping to print a rune on the map. Once it finishes printing, the time interval changes. This discord bot was made to track the time of the cube and notify whoever is interested by tagging a specific role they can be added to.

While this might be useless in a few weeks when the cube stops moving, I've decided to release this incase it ever comes in handy for whoever is trying to make a bot with similar commands.

This format is not ideal just yet. It is great for a utility bot with multiple jobs, however I would've preferred if I had made an abstract class for each command.

# Statistics
![stats](https://jadbalout.com/cube.png)
I'd just like to say that we reached a point where we had 35,000 users and 20,000 cached active users. We almost hit 200 users, however there is still time and it might happen. Thank you all for your amazing support.

# Setup
Please make sure you are running the latest version of Node.JS.
First thing you'd want to do is clone the repository and edit config.json(get your bot token from [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). After that, open whatever terminal you use and run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the packages you need to run the bot. After that, simply use `node Bot` and the bot will start.

# CubeBot
Recently on Fortnite, a strange cube has appeared. It has been moving on an interval and then stopping to print a rune on the map. Once it finishes printing, the time interval changes. This discord bot was made to track the time of the cube and notify whoever is interested by tagging a specific role they can be added to.

While this might be useless in a few weeks when the cube stops moving, I've decided to release this incase it ever comes in handy for whoever is trying to make a bot with similar commands.
